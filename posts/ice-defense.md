## Why This Page Exists

ICE detained 170+ US citizens in the first nine months of 2025. Citizens have been held for days without contact, denied phone access, and had valid documentation—including REAL IDs and tribal IDs—rejected. In Missouri, traffic stops are the primary enforcement method. Your concern is statistically justified.

## Immediate Action Checklist

### This Week

- [ ] **Get documentation for all family members**: US passport or passport card (strongest), certified birth certificate, REAL ID
- [ ] **Create emergency contact card**: Write down 314-370-7080 and 2-3 trusted contacts. Memorize them.
- [ ] **Designate emergency contacts**: Who can pick up your kids? Who has authority to access your accounts?
- [ ] **Compile document package**: Birth certificates, Social Security cards, marriage license, medical records, financial accounts. Give a copy to your trusted person.
- [ ] **Join or create a Signal group**: Your neighborhood needs an encrypted alert network. Not SMS—Signal.
- [ ] **Post "Know Your Rights" by your front door**: Remind everyone not to open the door without a judicial warrant.

### This Month

- [ ] **Consult an attorney** for Power of Attorney and standby guardianship (especially if you have children)
- [ ] **Attend Know Your Rights training**: Contact 314-370-7080 for local sessions
- [ ] **Install alert apps**: ICEBlock (iOS) or SignalSafe for real-time ICE activity tracking
- [ ] **Practice scenarios with family**: What happens if ICE knocks? What do the kids do?
- [ ] **Establish a mutual aid pod**: 5-10 households who look out for each other

### Ongoing

- [ ] Monitor @stlrapidresponse on Instagram for local enforcement patterns
- [ ] Update document package quarterly
- [ ] Refresh family scenarios monthly
- [ ] Report ICE sightings to hotline (314-370-7080) for community intelligence

## Know Your Rights

### At Home

**ICE cannot enter without a judicial warrant** (signed by a judge, with correct name and address). ICE administrative warrants are NOT judicial warrants.

1. Do not open the door
2. Ask to see the warrant—have them slide it under the door
3. State clearly: "I do not consent to entry"
4. Record through the window if safe
5. Teach children: don't answer the door for strangers

### In Public

1. Ask: "Am I being detained or am I free to leave?"
2. If free: walk away calmly
3. If detained: State "I am a US citizen" and show ID
4. Exercise your right to remain silent beyond asserting citizenship
5. Request an attorney immediately
6. Do not sign anything without an attorney

### During Traffic Stops

Federal settlement (*Castañon Nava v. DHS*) applies in Missouri. ICE must have specific articulable facts for stops—they cannot use traffic violations as pretext.

1. Ask if the officer is ICE or local police
2. Keep hands visible, be calm
3. You can record the interaction
4. If asked about immigration status, you can decline to answer
5. Document the encounter afterward

## Family Preparedness

### Documentation to Carry

- **US Passport/Passport Card** (strongest proof of citizenship)
- **Certified birth certificate**
- **State REAL ID** (proves lawful presence, not citizenship)
- **Tribal ID** if applicable (request a supervisor if refused)

Citizens are not legally required to carry proof, but having ID resolves most encounters. Without documentation, citizens have been detained for "verification."

### Emergency Document Package

Keep this accessible to your trusted person:

- Birth certificates for all family members
- Marriage license
- Social Security cards
- Medical records, prescriptions, insurance cards
- School records, immunization cards
- Financial account info, bills, insurance policies
- Power of Attorney forms (childcare, financial, medical)
- A-numbers if any family member has immigration documents

### Childcare Designation

Talk to an attorney about your options:

| Option | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Caregiver's Authorization Affidavit** | Temporary childcare without court involvement |
| **Standby Guardianship** | Emergency designation for immigration scenarios (preferred) |
| **Power of Attorney** | Handles finances/medical, NOT childcare decisions |
| **Court Guardianship** | Full transfer (difficult to terminate) |

Designate a trusted person with written authorization. Practice with children what to do.

## If Someone Is Detained

### First 24 Hours

1. **Locate the detainee**: [ICE Online Detainee Locator](https://locator.ice.gov/odls/) (may take 24-48 hours to appear)
   - Search by A-number + country of birth, OR name + DOB + country
2. **Contact an attorney immediately**: LSEM 314-256-8756, MICA 314-669-4290
3. **Activate your emergency contact tree**
4. **Secure childcare** via your designated caretaker
5. **Call rapid response**: 314-370-7080

### Within 72 Hours

- Attorney files bond hearing request
- Bond hearing typically scheduled within 1-2 weeks
- Activate Power of Attorney for finances/medical
- Notify employer/school as appropriate

### Wrongful Detention (US Citizens)

The federal *Castañon Nava* settlement allows individuals arrested without warrant or during an unlawful vehicle stop to seek immediate release. Your attorney should document:
- Citizenship status
- Violation of settlement terms
- File for immediate release from ICE custody

## Community Alert System

### How to Report ICE Sightings

1. **Verify**: Look for "POLICE ICE" on badges
2. **Text your group**: "ICE at [location] [time] [details: # officers, vehicles]"
3. **Call hotline**: 314-370-7080
4. **Do NOT post unverified info on public social media**

### Apps for Real-Time Alerts

- **ICEBlock** (iOS): Anonymous, 5-mile radius alerts
- **SignalSafe**: Citizen reports, moderator-verified

### Recording ICE Encounters

You have a First Amendment right to record law enforcement in public:
- Stand 8+ feet from the scene
- If told to step back, point camera at your feet while stepping back—keep recording
- Document: time, date, location, number of officers, badge numbers, vehicle descriptions, license plates

**Protocol: Observe and document, NOT obstruct.** Physical interference = felony charges. Recording = protected speech.

## Key Principle

**Proactive community infrastructure prevents reactive chaos.**

The difference between a 2-hour detention with ID shown versus a 48-hour incommunicado hold is preparation. The difference between children in state custody versus with a designated caretaker is paperwork completed today. The difference between isolated fear and collective protection is organizing neighbors now.

Build redundant systems: multiple emergency contacts, multiple forms of ID, multiple communication channels.

You're not paranoid. You're appropriately assessing risk. And you're not alone—start with 314-370-7080.
