My name is Chris Zempel. I'm a former consultant who worked on small, distributed teams turned enterprise, in-the-office developer. At present, I'm working at Maritz on an incentives platform.

**Who _are_ you, anyway?** A great question! I'll add more to this page later. It's 2018-08-15, and I still need to get this site out, point my domain at it, etc etc. I'll get back to this later... I promise!
