# Protection Playbook: ICE Detention Defense for Legal US Citizens

## Threat Assessment

ICE detained 170+ US citizens in the first nine months of 2025 alone, with racial profiling documented by independent oversight. Current detention population exceeds 68,000, with 73% having no criminal record. In Missouri, traffic stops are the primary enforcement method, and the state signed a 287(g) agreement with ICE in March 2025, training 45 state troopers in immigration enforcement. [propublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will)

Your friend's fear is statistically justified. Citizens have been detained for days without contact, denied phone access, and had valid documentation rejected, including REAL IDs and tribal IDs. [en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths,_detentions_and_deportations_of_American_citizens_in_the_second_Trump_administration)

## Preventative Measures

### Documentation

**Carry at all times:**
- US passport or passport card (strongest proof) [nslegalaid](https://nslegalaid.org/articles/essential-documents-to-carry-if-stopped-by-ice/)
- Birth certificate (certified copy)
- State REAL ID (proves lawful presence, not citizenship) [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/1q73c0z/how_does_ice_or_how_do_you_prove_your_own/)
- Tribal ID if applicable (know to request supervisor if refused) [narf](https://narf.org/ice-resources-2026/)

Citizens are not legally required to carry proof, but showing ID resolves most encounters. Without documentation, citizens have been detained for verification. [jeelani-law](https://www.jeelani-law.com/rights-as-an-immigrant/)

### Family Preparedness

**Emergency contacts (memorize phone numbers):**
- St. Louis Rapid Response Coalition: **314-370-7080** (primary hotline) [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis/comments/1o6k0sc/resources_to_protect_our_community_from_ice/)
- Immigration attorney (LSEM: 314-256-8756, MICA: 314-669-4290) [vlaa](https://vlaa.org/get-help/legal-service-providers/)
- 2-3 trusted backup contacts
- Children's school with authorized pickup list [immigrantjustice](https://immigrantjustice.org/for-immigrants/know-your-rights/ice-encounter/)

**Document package (accessible to trusted person):** [ilrc](https://www.ilrc.org/sites/default/files/resources/family_preparedness_plan.pdf)
- Birth certificates, marriage license, Social Security cards
- A-numbers if any family member has immigration documents [citizenpath](https://citizenpath.com/alien-registration-number-explained/)
- Medical records, prescriptions, insurance
- School records, immunization cards
- Financial accounts, bills, insurance policies
- Power of Attorney forms (childcare, financial, medical) [informedimmigrant](https://www.informedimmigrant.com/resources/know-your-rights/steps-take-prepare-family/)

**Childcare designation:** [immigrantjustice](https://immigrantjustice.org/for-immigrants/know-your-rights/plan-ahead-protect-your-family-event-deportation/)
Consult attorney for state-specific options:
- **Caregiver's Authorization Affidavit**: Temporary childcare without court
- **Standby Guardianship**: Emergency designation for immigration scenarios (preferred)
- **Power of Attorney**: Handles finances/medical, NOT childcare decisions
- **Court Guardianship**: Full transfer (difficult to terminate)

Designate trusted person with written authorization. Practice with children: don't open door for strangers, call emergency contact. [ilrc](https://www.ilrc.org/sites/default/files/2024-11/Step-by-Step%20Family%20Preparedness%20Plan_ENG_FULL_Nov%202024.pdf)

### Know Your Rights (All Encounters)

**At home:** [immigrantjustice](https://immigrantjustice.org/for-immigrants/know-your-rights/ice-encounter/)
- Don't open door without judicial warrant (judge signature + correct name/address)
- ICE administrative warrants are NOT judicial warrants
- Ask to slide warrant under door
- Record through window if safe
- State: "I do not consent to entry"

**In public:** [internationalservices.gwu](https://internationalservices.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs6431/files/2025-04/KYR.pdf)
- Ask: "Am I being detained or free to leave?"
- If free: walk away calmly
- If detained: State "I am a US citizen" + show ID
- Exercise right to remain silent beyond citizenship assertion
- Request attorney immediately
- Don't sign anything without attorney

**In vehicle (Missouri-specific):** [cliniclegal](https://www.cliniclegal.org/resources/enforcement-and-detention/settlement-limits-ices-power-stop-vehicles-and-make-arrests)
Federal settlement *Castañon Nava v. DHS* applies statewide. ICE must have specific articulable facts for stops; cannot use traffic violations as pretext. If stopped, ask if officer is ICE or local police. Document interaction if safe. [immigrantjustice](https://immigrantjustice.org/for-immigrants/know-your-rights/ice-encounter/)

## Communication Systems

### Rapid Response Network

**St. Louis hotline: 314-370-7080** (call or text) [ashreifoundation](https://www.ashreifoundation.org/rapid-response)
- Services: Legal aid connections, detention locator assistance, power of attorney help, family support
- Volunteer opportunities: Bilingual operators needed
- Instagram: @stlrapidresponse

**Additional legal aid:**
- Legal Services of Eastern Missouri: 314-256-8756 [immigrationadvocates](https://www.immigrationadvocates.org/nonprofit/legaldirectory/organization.393053-Legal_Services_of_Eastern_Missouri_Immigration_Law_Project_St_Louis_Office)

### Community Alert Infrastructure

**Encrypted communication (required for sensitive coordination):** [mutualaiddisasterrelief](https://mutualaiddisasterrelief.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Community-Defense.pdf)
- Signal (messaging, calls, video) — NOT standard SMS
- ProtonMail (email)
- WhatsApp groups (secondary)

Standard text messages leak metadata to carriers and are insecure. [freedom](https://freedom.press/digisec/blog/added-to-the-ice-group-chat/)

**Real-time ICE activity tracking:**
- ICEBlock app (iOS, anonymous, 5-mile alerts) [cnn](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/30/tech/iceblock-app-trump-immigration-crackdown)
- SignalSafe (citizen reports, moderator-verified) [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/the-rise-of-social-media-as-a-diy-alert-system-for-ice-raids/)
- Neighborhood WhatsApp/Signal groups [codepink](https://www.codepink.org/latam_ice)

**Alert protocol when ICE spotted:** [justice4all](https://www.justice4all.org/rapid-response-toolkit/)
1. Verify badges say "POLICE ICE"
2. Text group: "ICE at [location] [time] [details: # officers, vehicles]"
3. Call hotline: 314-370-7080
4. Do NOT post unverified info on public social media [immigrantjustice](https://immigrantjustice.org/for-immigrants/know-your-rights/ice-encounter/)

## Intelligence Gathering & Processing

### ICE Activity Patterns (St. Louis)

**Primary method: Traffic stops** [dps.mo](https://dps.mo.gov/safer-missouri/)
- Minor violations used: expired plates, window tint, speeding
- Local police cooperation varies by jurisdiction
- I-44 corridor high-risk (Chicago-Texas trafficking route) [kcur](https://www.kcur.org/news/2025-09-22/ice-police-midwest-immigration-raids-civil-rights)

**High-risk locations:** [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis/comments/1o6k0sc/resources_to_protect_our_community_from_ice/)
- St. Charles, Arnold, South County reported activity

**Missouri enforcement infrastructure:**
- 287(g) agreements: MO State Highway Patrol + Pulaski County Sheriff [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unQ9gTVv9sA)
- County jails holding ICE detainees: Phelps, Greene, Ste. Genevieve [theappeal](https://theappeal.org/jail-support-for-immigrants-held-in-missouri-offers-resistance-in-a-red-state/)
- Anti-sanctuary state law prohibits local non-cooperation [reformtransform](https://reformtransform.org/scorecard/ice-st-louis/)

### Legal Observer Documentation

**First Amendment rights:** [startribune](https://www.startribune.com/what-ice-agents-can-and-cant-do-and-what-legal-rights-the-public-has-during-encounters/601560316)
Federal courts affirm right to record law enforcement in public. Stand 8+ feet from scene. If told to step back, point camera at feet and record yourself stepping back while continuing to record. [startribune](https://www.startribune.com/what-ice-agents-can-and-cant-do-and-what-legal-rights-the-public-has-during-encounters/601560316)

**What to document:** [justice4all](https://www.justice4all.org/rapid-response-toolkit/)
- Time, date, location
- Number of officers, badge numbers if visible
- Vehicle descriptions, license plates
- Officer statements
- Detainee information if accessible (name, contact for family)

**Legal observer training:** [fox9](https://www.fox9.com/news/minneapolis-ice-shooting-interest-constitutional-observer-trainings-rises)
- Immigrant Defense Network (national model: 2000+ trained)
- National Lawyers Guild Legal Observer Program
- St. Louis rapid response coalition (contact 314-370-7080 for local training)

**Protocol: Observe and document, NOT obstruct.** Physical interference = criminal charges. Recording = protected speech. [minnlawyer](https://minnlawyer.com/2026/01/12/ice-monitoring-activists-first-amendment-legal-questions/)

### Verification Teams

Rapid response networks dispatch trained verifiers to confirm ICE sightings reported via hotlines. Verifiers: [minnlawyer](https://minnlawyer.com/2026/01/12/ice-monitoring-activists-first-amendment-legal-questions/)
- Safely observe from distance
- Document with photos/video
- Get contact info for detained person's family if possible
- Report verified details to network for alerts
- Connect families with legal aid

## Contingencies

### If Someone Is Detained

**First 24 hours:**
1. **Locate detainee**: ICE Online Detainee Locator https://locator.ice.gov/odls/ [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hHJC0Z1sO4)
   - Search by A-number + country of birth OR name + DOB + country
   - Can take 24-48 hours to appear in system
2. **Contact attorney immediately** (LSEM: 314-256-8756, MICA: 314-669-4290)
3. **Activate emergency contact tree**
4. **Secure childcare** via designated caretaker
5. **Contact rapid response**: 314-370-7080

**Within 72 hours:**
- Attorney files bond hearing request (no fee) [thevisafirm](https://thevisafirm.com/dc-immigration-lawyer/bond/hearing-process/)
- Bond hearing scheduled: 7 days (certain asylum cases) to 1-2 weeks typical [americanimmigrationcouncil](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/detained-asylum-seekers-bond-hearing-7-days/)
- Consular notification if not US citizen (varies by country) [mopca](https://mopca.com/wp-content/uploads/Consular-Notification-Access.doc)
- Power of Attorney activated for finances/medical decisions
- Employer/school notifications as appropriate

**Wrongful detention (US citizens):** [cliniclegal](https://www.cliniclegal.org/resources/enforcement-and-detention/settlement-limits-ices-power-stop-vehicles-and-make-arrests)
In Missouri, federal settlement allows individuals arrested without warrant or during unlawful vehicle stop to seek immediate release. Attorney must document:
- Citizenship status
- Violation of settlement terms (lack of probable cause, pretextual stop)
- File for immediate release from ICE custody

### Community Defense Structure

**Rapid response network components:** [cliniclegal](https://www.cliniclegal.org/toolkits/rapid-response-toolkit)
- 24-hour hotline (trained volunteer operators)
- Legal observer teams (constitutional rights monitoring)
- Verification teams (dispatch to confirm sightings)
- Legal referral network
- Accompaniment volunteers (jail support, family assistance)
- Mutual aid services (groceries, transportation, childcare)

**Training pipeline:** [miracoalition](https://miracoalition.org/know-your-rights-trainings/)
- Know Your Rights workshops
- Legal observer protocols
- Bystander intervention
- De-escalation techniques
- Encrypted communications
- Trauma-informed support

### Physical Preparation

**Home security:**
- Post "Know Your Rights" cards by door
- Teach children not to answer door [ilrc](https://www.ilrc.org/sites/default/files/2024-11/Step-by-Step%20Family%20Preparedness%20Plan_ENG_FULL_Nov%202024.pdf)
- Identify safe indoor space away from windows
- Keep recording devices (phone) accessible
- Practice scenario: ICE at door without warrant

**Transportation:**
- Use mutual aid rides to reduce traffic stop exposure [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis/comments/1o6k0sc/resources_to_protect_our_community_from_ice/)
- Keep dashcam recording if available
- Know vehicle stop rights under *Castañon Nava* settlement [cliniclegal](https://www.cliniclegal.org/resources/enforcement-and-detention/settlement-limits-ices-power-stop-vehicles-and-make-arrests)
- Travel in groups when possible during enforcement surges

**Public safety:**
- Carry citizenship documentation [aclu-nj](https://www.aclu-nj.org/know-your-rights/what-do-if-youre-approached-immigration-officials-new-jersey/)
- Memorize attorney/hotline numbers [ilrc](https://www.ilrc.org/sites/default/files/resources/family_preparedness_plan.pdf)
- Use community alert apps (ICEBlock, SignalSafe) [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/the-rise-of-social-media-as-a-diy-alert-system-for-ice-raids/)
- Stay informed via @stlrapidresponse Instagram [ashreifoundation](https://www.ashreifoundation.org/rapid-response)

## Martial/Self-Defense Considerations

**Legal constraints:**
Physical resistance to federal officers = felony charges (assaulting federal officer, obstruction). Even citizens wrongfully detained have been charged; most charges dropped but detention extends. [propublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will)

**De-escalation prioritized over confrontation:** [police1](https://www.police1.com/police-products/training/simulator/innovating-de-escalation-training-with-community-engagement-and-advanced-technology)
- Verbal de-escalation training (MIRA Coalition, DC Peace Team) [bridgingdivides.princeton](https://bridgingdivides.princeton.edu/sites/g/files/toruqf6646/files/documents/8_11_22_National_De-escalation_&_Active_Bystander_Training_Directory-2.pdf)
- Bystander intervention techniques (observe, not interfere) [miracoalition](https://miracoalition.org/know-your-rights-trainings/)
- Grounding exercises for staying calm under stress [mindsetsafetymanagement](https://mindsetsafetymanagement.com/the-importance-of-de-escalation-training-for-first-responders-in-todays-crisis-climate/)
- Community defense philosophy: document and witness, don't physically obstruct [fox9](https://www.fox9.com/news/minneapolis-ice-shooting-interest-constitutional-observer-trainings-rises)

**Community protection models:** [rop](https://rop.org/resources/menu-of-options-community-protection-and-rapid-response/)
- Legal observer presence as deterrent to rights violations
- Whistles/noise to alert neighborhood during enforcement [fox9](https://www.fox9.com/news/minneapolis-ice-shooting-interest-constitutional-observer-trainings-rises)
- Constitutional observer networks (badge/whistle identification) [fox9](https://www.fox9.com/news/minneapolis-ice-shooting-interest-constitutional-observer-trainings-rises)
- Rapid mobilization within minutes via alert systems

Training focuses on psychological safety, not physical confrontation. Self-defense classes offered by some mutual aid groups but used for personal safety, not ICE resistance. [805undocufund](https://www.805undocufund.org/trainings.html)

## Implementation Priorities

### Immediate (This week):
1. Obtain/verify citizenship documentation for all family members
2. Create emergency contact card, memorize 314-370-7080
3. Designate trusted emergency contacts
4. Compile document package, give copy to trusted person
5. Join neighborhood Signal/WhatsApp alert group or create one
6. Post "Know Your Rights" info by front door

### Short-term (This month):
1. Consult attorney for Power of Attorney/standby guardianship
2. Attend Know Your Rights training
3. Install ICEBlock or SignalSafe app
4. Practice ICE encounter scenarios with family
5. Connect with rapid response coalition for volunteer training
6. Establish neighborhood mutual aid pod (5-10 households)

### Ongoing:
1. Monitor @stlrapidresponse for local enforcement patterns
2. Participate in legal observer network
3. Update document package quarterly
4. Refresh family practice scenarios monthly
5. Contribute to mutual aid network (skills, resources, time)
6. Report ICE sightings to hotline for community intelligence

## Key Operational Principle

**Proactive community infrastructure prevents reactive chaos.** The difference between a 2-hour detention with ID shown versus a 48-hour incommunicado hold is preparation. The difference between children in state custody versus with designated caretaker is paperwork completed today. The difference between isolated fear and collective protection is organizing neighbors now.

Build redundant systems: multiple emergency contacts, multiple forms of ID, multiple communication channels, multiple trained legal observers. Single points of failure are vulnerabilities.

Your friend needs to hear: They're not paranoid. They're appropriately risk-assessing. And they're not alone—there's infrastructure to plug into starting with 314-370-7080.
